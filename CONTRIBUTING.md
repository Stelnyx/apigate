# Contributing to ApiGate

Thanks for your interest. ApiGate is a static API surface auditor — contributions that improve parser accuracy, reduce false positives, or extend framework coverage are especially welcome.

## Ground rules

- Be respectful — see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Report security issues privately — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Never open a public issue for a vulnerability.
- Open an issue before large changes so we can align on scope.
- ApiGate consumes [`@stelnyx/report-theme`](https://github.com/Stelnyx/report-theme) as the single source of truth for HTML report rendering. Do not fork or restyle locally — see [DESIGN_PARITY.md](DESIGN_PARITY.md).

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stelnyx/ApiGate.git
cd ApiGate
npm install
node apigate.js --help

# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint
```

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] Branch name describes the change (`feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`)
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`)
- [ ] New parsers / detectors include a test fixture and assertions
- [ ] If golden numbers in `test/golden-apigate.mjs` move, the PR description explains why
- [ ] `npm test` passes; `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] If the report HTML changed, `test/report-theme-contract.mjs` still passes and no `<!doctype>` literal was introduced outside `lib/report.mjs`
- [ ] README updated if CLI flags, config fields, or output shape changed

## Releases

ApiGate publishes through npm trusted publishing from GitHub Actions. Do not
store `NPM_TOKEN` / `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` secrets for release publishing, and do not
publish from a local machine with a `--provenance=false` workaround.

Trusted Publisher settings on npmjs.com for `@stelnyx/apigate`:

- Publisher: GitHub Actions
- Organization/user: `Stelnyx`
- Repository: `apigate`
- Workflow filename: `publish.yml`
- Environment: leave blank
- Allowed action: `npm publish`

The repository must remain public for npm to show provenance. The package's
`repository` field must keep matching the GitHub repository exactly.

Release flow:

1. Bump `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the next semver version.
2. Run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
3. Commit the version bump and push `main`.
4. Create and push a matching tag, for example `git tag v0.3.3 && git push origin v0.3.3`.
5. Create a GitHub Release from that tag.
6. Confirm the `Publish` workflow runs green.
7. Confirm the new npm version shows provenance, then run `npm audit signatures`.

## Commit message format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<optional body explaining why, not what>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `security`, `perf`.

## Flag discipline

ApiGate aims for *few flags, each with a clear scenario*. Reviewers should
be able to read `apigate --help` in 30 seconds. Before adding a CLI flag,
the contribution must satisfy:

1. **Scenario in one line.** Every new flag needs a one-sentence "developer
   uses this when X" justification in its help text. If you can't write it,
   the flag isn't ready.
2. **Group it.** The `--help` output is grouped by purpose: **Output**,
   **Investigation**, **Policy**, **Debug**. New flags slot into one of
   those four groups. New groups need their own discussion.
3. **No overlap with config.** If the flag has no scenario beyond
   `.apigate.config.json`, make it config-only.
4. **No overlap with env vars.** Use the `APIGATE_*` env-var convention
   where it makes sense (e.g. `APIGATE_TIMESTAMP` replaces the now-removed
   `--deterministic` flag in v0.2).
5. **README quick-start stays 3 lines.** The first code block in
   `README.md` shows `npx @stelnyx/apigate .` plus at most two examples.
   Don't surface every flag upfront.
6. **Errors over silence.** Unknown flag values throw — silent-ignore can
   relax CI policy by accident.

If a proposed flag doesn't pass all six, the PR will be asked to drop it
or convert to a config field.

## Adding a new framework parser

1. Add `lib/parsers/<name>.mjs` exporting `parse<Name>(targetDir, excludePaths) → { endpoints, warnings, specsDetected? }`.
2. Wire it into `lib/inventory.mjs` behind a `frameworks.<name>` toggle.
3. Add a fixture under `test/fixtures/<name>-app/` and a `test/parser-<name>.mjs` suite.
4. Add a row to the Frameworks table in `README.md`.
5. Add the framework's idiomatic auth identifiers to `CONFIG_DEFAULTS.auth.<name>` in `lib/config.mjs`.
