**ApiGate** is the fourth surface in the Stelnyx line ([LuxScope](https://github.com/Stelnyx/LuxScope), [LuxFaber](https://github.com/Stelnyx/LuxFaber), [SecGate](https://github.com/Stelnyx/SecGate), **ApiGate**). It reads source code and OpenAPI specs on disk and produces one report: every endpoint, its declared auth posture, the drift between code and spec, scored against five 0–100 rubrics. **100% static** — no HTTP requests, no credentials, no running server. Zero network calls. Same input → byte-identical output.

**Honest positioning.** ApiGate is a **surface auditor**, not a runtime scanner and not a DAST tool. The report explicitly states what a static analysis CAN and CANNOT prove — it's a printed trust feature, not a footnote. ApiGate cannot verify runtime authorization (BOLA / object-level access). It can prove that an endpoint declares a guard. It cannot prove the guard is correct. See [What this does NOT prove](#what-this-does-not-prove).

**Status.** Early release (`v0.1.2`). Published with [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements). Report vulnerabilities via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Accuracy contract.** ApiGate's parsing + scoring pipeline is deterministic — same inputs produce JSON- and HTML-byte-identical reports across every run. Three test suites lock the contract:

- `test/determinism.mjs` — byte-equality of JSON and HTML across reruns of every parser, classifier, diff, score, and renderer call.
- `test/golden-apigate.mjs` — hand-crafted multi-framework fixture; expected endpoint count, posture distribution, drift buckets, and headline score are inline so any change surfaces in code review.
- `test/report-theme-contract.mjs` — asserts the HTML report is rendered through `@stelnyx/report-theme`, not by a parallel local renderer.

---

## Headline Score

Every run produces a **Headline Score (0–100)** alongside the binary PASS/FAIL gate. The score is the arithmetic mean of five 0–100 rubrics:

```
Headline:  86 / 100   █████████████████░░░   STRONG  rubric v1

  Inventory         86 / 100   █████████████████░░░
  Auth Coverage     67 / 100   █████████████░░░░░░░
  Open Risk         85 / 100   █████████████████░░░
  Spec Drift        90 / 100   ██████████████████░░
  Determinism      100 / 100   ████████████████████
```

| Rubric              | What it measures                                                                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inventory Resolved** | `100 × resolved / total`. Routes mounted via dynamic prefixes drag this down — never silently dropped. |
| **Auth Coverage**      | `100 × guarded / (guarded + open + unknown)`. UNKNOWN counts against — a route we couldn't classify is not a confirmed guard. Intentional-public endpoints (login/signup/refresh/health/...) are excluded — they're declared public-by-design, not a coverage gap. |
| **Open Endpoint Risk** | Starts at 100. Open write methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) `-12` each; open GETs `-3` each. Floor 0.    |
| **Spec Drift**         | Starts at 100. Shadow `-5`, stale `-5`, auth-drift `-10` each. `null` (excluded from mean) when no spec found. |
| **Determinism**        | Locked at 100 in v0.1. The byte-equality test is what actually enforces it.                            |

Bands: `STRONG ≥ 85`, `GOOD ≥ 70`, `MIXED ≥ 50`, `WEAK < 50`. Same bands as SecGate / LuxFaber / LuxScope.

The binary gate (exit 1 on open write methods, configurable) is independent of the score. `headlineScore` + `rubrics` are written to `apigate-report.json` for CI dashboards and trend tracking.

---

## TL;DR

```bash
npx @stelnyx/apigate .
```

Inventories every HTTP endpoint, classifies auth posture, diffs against any OpenAPI spec, writes a JSON report + a self-contained HTML report. Exit `0` on clean, `1` on open-write endpoints (default policy). That's the whole product.

---

## What it does today

ApiGate walks source files in a directory and produces:

- **One normalized JSON report** — every endpoint, posture, drift bucket, rubric, headline
- **One self-contained HTML report** — rendered through `@stelnyx/report-theme`; visually + structurally identical to SecGate / LuxScope / LuxFaber reports
- **One exit code** — `1` on open-write endpoints (configurable); blocks CI

ApiGate does not run code. It does not send HTTP requests. It does not require credentials or a running server. Everything happens at parse-time against source files.

---

## Frameworks

| Framework  | Detection                                                                                                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Express**  | acorn AST for `.js/.mjs/.cjs`; regex fallback for `.ts/.tsx`. Resolves `app.use('/prefix', router)` mounts in same file. |
| **Fastify**  | acorn AST. Handles `fastify.<method>(...)` and `fastify.route({ method, url, preHandler })`.                             |
| **NestJS**   | Decorator extraction over `.ts/.js`. Pairs `@Controller(...)` with method decorators `@Get / @Post / @Put / @Patch / @Delete / @Options / @Head / @All`. Captures class- and method-level guards (`@UseGuards`, `@Auth`, `@Roles`, `@ApiBearerAuth`). |
| **OpenAPI**  | Parses `*.yaml`/`*.yml`/`*.json` with `swagger:` (2.0) or `openapi:` (3.x) root. Honors operation-level `security` and root inheritance. |

Routes that can't be statically resolved (dynamic mount prefixes, computed method names, unparseable files) are emitted as `UNRESOLVED` — never guessed. They count against the **Inventory Resolved** rubric so the report tells you what ApiGate could and couldn't see.

---

## Network access

ApiGate makes **zero** network calls. No telemetry, no account, no phone-home, no advisory database, no spec fetching from URLs. Reports are written to local files only. Code never leaves your machine.

This is unconditional, not a flag. Air-gapped CI works as well as a developer laptop.

---

## What this does NOT prove

The honesty wedge of ApiGate. The report renders this section in every run, never hidden behind a toggle:

1. **Static analysis cannot verify runtime authorization (BOLA / object-level access).** ApiGate only inspects declared auth posture, not the correctness of the auth middleware itself.
2. An endpoint with a declared auth identifier in its middleware chain is classified `GUARDED` — the middleware may still be misconfigured, bypassable, or insecure at runtime.
3. Routes mounted via dynamic strings (computed prefixes, runtime registration, factory functions) are reported as `UNRESOLVED` rather than guessed.
4. ApiGate uses a built-in heuristic pattern list to mark common public-auth paths (login / signup / refresh / health / OAuth callbacks) as **intentional-public**. The heuristic is deterministic and configurable but can be wrong both ways — review the marked endpoints and override `publicAuthPatterns` in `.apigate.config.json` if your project disagrees.
5. ApiGate makes zero network calls. It does not send code, telemetry, or scan artifacts anywhere.

If you need runtime authorization testing (BOLA, IDOR, broken object-level auth), use a dynamic scanner. ApiGate complements DAST tooling; it does not replace it.

### Heuristic posture: public-by-design

Most APIs intentionally expose a handful of unauthenticated endpoints — sign-up, login, refresh, password reset, OAuth callbacks, health probes. Without help, ApiGate's `openWriteMethods: true` default would flag every one of these as FAIL on first run.

ApiGate ships a deterministic, exact-match list of these patterns (see `lib/heuristics.mjs` → `DEFAULT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PATTERNS`). Endpoints matched by the list:

- **Stay in the inventory** — they're never hidden.
- **Keep their declared posture** (OPEN / UNKNOWN) — the heuristic does not lie about what the code says.
- **Are excluded from the default exit-1 gate.**
- **Are excluded from the Auth Coverage denominator.**
- Are tagged `PUBLIC` (in addition to their posture) in the HTML report.

Override the pattern list:

```json
{
  "publicAuthPatterns": [
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/api/v2/auth/login" },
    { "method": "GET",  "path": "/api/v2/auth/google/callback" }
  ]
}
```

`[]` disables the heuristic entirely (every open endpoint counts).
`failOn.intentionalPublic: true` keeps the heuristic for the report but makes those endpoints fail the gate (strict / compliance mode).

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @stelnyx/apigate
```

### One-shot via npx

```bash
npx @stelnyx/apigate .
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stelnyx/ApiGate.git
cd ApiGate
npm install
chmod +x apigate.js
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/apigate.js" /usr/local/bin/apigate
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Scan current directory
apigate .

# Scan a specific path
apigate /path/to/project

# Write reports to a custom directory
apigate /path/to/project --output-dir /tmp/reports

# Strip absolute paths (auto-on when CI=true)
apigate /path/to/project --strip-paths

# JSON only / HTML only
apigate . --format json
apigate . --format html

# Show parser warnings
apigate . --debug

# Tighten the gate at CI time without editing .apigate.config.json
apigate . --fail-on open-write,unknown,drift,missing-spec

# Version / help
apigate --version
apigate --help
```

**`--fail-on` tokens** (comma-separated):

| Token                | Maps to                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `open-write`         | `failOn.openWriteMethods = true`         |
| `open-read`          | `failOn.openReadMethods  = true`         |
| `unknown`            | `failOn.unknown          = true`         |
| `drift`              | `failOn.drift            = true`         |
| `intentional-public` | `failOn.intentionalPublic = true`        |
| `missing-spec`       | `requireSpec             = true`         |

Unknown tokens throw — CI typos can never silently relax policy.

**Exit codes**

| Code | Meaning                                                          |
|:----:|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | PASS — `gate.reasons` is empty                                   |
| `1`  | FAIL — `gate.reasons[]` lists the exact gate(s) that fired       |
| `2`  | Invalid target or CLI error                                      |

The `gate.reasons[]` array in the JSON report holds the locked enum set
(`drift`, `intentional-public`, `missing-spec`, `open-read`, `open-write`,
`unknown-endpoint`) sorted lexicographically and deduplicated, so CI can
grep failure causes without scraping stdout.

## Configuration

Create `.apigate.config.json` in your scan target directory. All fields optional.

```json
{
  "frameworks": {
    "express": true, "fastify": true, "nest": true, "openapi": true
  },
  "auth": {
    "express":  ["requireAuth", "passport.authenticate", "jwt"],
    "fastify":  ["onRequest", "preHandler", "fastify.authenticate"],
    "nest":     ["UseGuards", "AuthGuard", "JwtAuthGuard"]
  },
  "failOn": {
    "openWriteMethods":  true,
    "openReadMethods":   false,
    "unknown":           false,
    "drift":             false,
    "intentionalPublic": false
  },
  "requireSpec": false,
  "strictPublic": false,
  "excludePaths": ["node_modules/**", "dist/**", "**/*.test.*"]
}
```

A fully-commented example config lives at [`.apigate.config.example.json`](.apigate.config.example.json) — copy into your repo as `.apigate.config.json` and edit.

### Field reference

| Field         | Type    | Default                                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `frameworks`  | object  | all `true`                             | Toggle individual parsers                                                  |
| `auth`        | object  | per-framework defaults                 | Identifier names that classify an endpoint as `GUARDED` when present       |
| `failOn`      | object  | `{ openWriteMethods: true, unknown: false, drift: false }` | Exit-code policy                                  |
| `requireSpec` | boolean | `false`                                | Fail when no OpenAPI 2/3 spec is detected                                |
| `strictPublic`| boolean | `false`                                | Disable built-in public-auth patterns unless `publicAuthPatterns` is set  |
| `excludePaths`| array   | `node_modules/`, `dist/`, test dirs    | Globs of files to skip                                                    |

### Precedence

```
CLI flag  >  .apigate.config.json  >  built-in defaults
```

Missing config: silent, defaults apply. Invalid JSON: error logged, defaults apply.

### Auth identifier configuration

ApiGate's classifier reports `GUARDED` when one of the declared auth identifiers appears in the endpoint's middleware/decorator chain. The defaults cover the common framework idioms (`passport.authenticate`, `@UseGuards`, Fastify `preHandler`). For project-specific helpers (e.g., a custom `requireOrg` middleware), extend the list:

```json
{ "auth": { "express": ["requireAuth", "requireOrg", "requireBilling"] } }
```

ApiGate does **not** inspect what these identifiers do at runtime. Their declared presence is the signal — that's the static-analysis honesty contract.

---

## Sample report

A live sample lives at [`samples/realworld-express/`](samples/realworld-express/) — ApiGate's report for the canonical [RealWorld backend](https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app) (vendored at a pinned commit under `test/fixtures/realworld-express/`).

```
Headline: 100 / 100  STRONG       rubric v1
  Inventory       100 / 100
  Auth Coverage   100 / 100
  Open Risk       100 / 100
  Spec Drift      n/a / 100
  Determinism     100 / 100

20 endpoints discovered (17 guarded · 3 open · 0 unknown · 3 intentional-public)
STATUS: PASS
```

The 3 open endpoints are sign-up / login / status — all matched by the built-in **intentional-public heuristic** (see [Heuristic posture](#heuristic-posture-public-by-design)), so they're listed in the report but don't trip the default exit-1 gate.

**Strict mode** (`failOn.intentionalPublic: true` in `.apigate.config.json`) treats the heuristic as advisory and fails on those endpoints too — the same run produces STATUS: FAIL and surfaces sign-up / login as findings. Useful for compliance audits where every open route must be justified.

For tighter CI gates:

```json
{
  "failOn": { "unknown": true, "intentionalPublic": true },
  "requireSpec": true,
  "strictPublic": true
}
```

`failOn.unknown` means "cannot prove guarded" fails the run. `requireSpec` prevents a green drift score when no OpenAPI file is present. `strictPublic` disables the built-in public-auth list unless your repo provides `publicAuthPatterns`.

---

## CI / CD

### GitHub Actions — minimal

```yaml
- name: Run ApiGate
  run: npx @stelnyx/apigate .
  # exits 1 on open write endpoints by default — blocks the pipeline
```

### Non-blocking (report only)

```yaml
- name: Run ApiGate
  run: npx @stelnyx/apigate . || true

- name: Upload report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: apigate-report
    path: |
      apigate-report.json
      *.html
```

---

## Report output

Each run writes:

- **`apigate-report.json`** — machine-readable, schema below
- **`<repo-name>.html`** — self-contained HTML report (rendered through `@stelnyx/report-theme`)

### New keys in v0.1.2

| Key                          | Why                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gate.reasons[]`             | Enum-locked list of gates that fired. CI can grep this directly instead of parsing stdout.   |
| `endpoints[].matchedAuthMarker` | First declared identifier that triggered a GUARDED classification. Reviewable trust signal. |
| `summary.unknownReasons{}`   | Per-`unresolvedReason` counts. Turns "low inventory" into actionable triage.                  |
| `parserCapabilities{}`       | Frozen matrix of what each parser sees vs. intentionally leaves unresolved. The honesty contract, machine-readable. |

### Posture tiers

| Posture     | Meaning                                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GUARDED** | At least one declared auth identifier present in the endpoint's middleware/decorator chain |
| **OPEN**    | Endpoint resolved, no auth identifier present                                            |
| **UNKNOWN** | Endpoint itself is unresolved, OR (specs) no security block present                      |

### `matchedAuthMarker` in practice — what reviewability looks like

`matchedAuthMarker` (added in v0.1.2) is the lever for catching a false GUARDED without changing the trust model. The classifier still flags an endpoint GUARDED when any declared identifier appears in its decorator chain — but the report now shows you exactly *which* identifier triggered the match, so an unusual one stands out.

Real example from dogfooding v0.1.2 against a 423-endpoint production NestJS app:

```
matchedAuthMarker distribution (GUARDED endpoints):
  313  ApiBearerAuth   ← Swagger documentation decorator
   12  UseGuards       ← actual runtime guard
    2  Roles
```

`@ApiBearerAuth()` is a Swagger documentation decorator, **not** a runtime guard. 313 of the 327 GUARDED endpoints matched on it. Most are still protected by a global `APP_GUARD` registered in `app.module.ts` (invisible to static analysis — see `parserCapabilities.nest`), but 39 had no other guard identifier in their decorator chain at all. Without `matchedAuthMarker` those would have been silent in the report. With it, the reviewer has a 30-second triage path.

If your codebase wants to drop the false signal entirely, remove `ApiBearerAuth` from `auth.nest` in `.apigate.config.json`. ApiGate's defaults are intentionally permissive (the cost of missing a real guard outweighs the cost of a false GUARDED that `matchedAuthMarker` makes visible).

---

## Design parity

ApiGate is visually + structurally indistinguishable from SecGate, LuxScope, and LuxFaber. The HTML report is rendered through `@stelnyx/report-theme@^0.1.0` — the same version, same imports, same shell envelope, no fork, no local restyle. See [DESIGN_PARITY.md](DESIGN_PARITY.md) for the contract.

If a missing theme component blocks ApiGate, the resolution is an upstream PR to `report-theme`, not a local patch. That's how the four-tool shelf stays one product.
